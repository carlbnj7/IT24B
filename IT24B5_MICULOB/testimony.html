        <h1>What I Learned from Lab Exercise 5</h1>
        <p>In Lab Exercise 5, I learned a lot about the process of creating a website from scratch. This project helped me deepen my understanding of HTML and CSS, two essential tools for web development. Structuring the content properly using HTML tags and others taught me the importance of clean, well-organized code. This structure makes the website not only functional but also user-friendly and easier to maintain.</p>

        <p>Moreover, I gained practical experience with CSS styling, which plays a significant role in enhancing the look and feel of a website. I learned how to effectively use CSS to style different components, manage layouts, and implement responsive designs. By applying specific styles like text formatting, color schemes, and positioning, I saw firsthand how design choices can impact the user experience.</p>

        <p>One of the most valuable lessons I took away from this exercise was the importance of integrating multimedia elements, such as images and videos, into a website. These components add a dynamic, interactive aspect to the user experience, making the site more engaging and visually appealing. Overall, this lab gave me a solid foundation in web design, and I now feel more confident in building and styling websites using HTML and CSS.</p>
